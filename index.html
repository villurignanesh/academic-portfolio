    <p>Hello there, and welcome to my homepage!<br><br>My name is &lt;Gnaneswar Villuri&gt;, and I am a &lt;PhD
        Student&gt; at &lt;Stony Brook University&gt;.As a Graduate Research Assistant, I have made impactful
        contributions to NLP and ML pipelines, enhancing accuracy while optimizing computational efficiency. My work
        encompasses designing and implementing hybrid ML models, integrating cutting-edge NLP techniques, and advancing
        model interpretability in large language models. By exploring the nuances of spoken language, I have helped
        uncover and address linguistic ambiguities, driving more robust and intelligent AI systems.<br><br>

        I maintain a list of my publications, research projects and implementations under the <a
            href="/research/">Research</a> tab, and a list of other non-research projects under the <a
            href="/projects">Projects</a> tab. You may also check out my <a href="">Github profile.</a><br><br>

        To get a better insight on my life so far, you can have a look at my <a href="/cv">resume</a>. Feel free to read
        a bit more <a href="/about">about me</a>.</p>
