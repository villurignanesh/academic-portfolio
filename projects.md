Here is a non-exhaustive list of my non-research projects. My research work can be found <a href="/research">here</a>. You can also check out my Github profile <a href="">here</a> for a complete list of my projects.

<ul>
	<li>
		<b>SmartTutor: RAG-based Learning Assistant</b>: Engineered an AI-powered tutor utilizing Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) for Stereo Vision, processing 300 pages and generating 10,000 vector embeddings. Integrated Mistral AI (92% accuracy) and a custom RAG model (94% accuracy), boosting retrieval accuracy to 95% with a 2-second average response time. Optimized model selection to operate on distil-GPT2, overcoming hardware constraints.<br>
