Passionate PhD researcher and Machine Learning Engineer with a focus on scalable ML algorithms, deep learning, and reinforcement learning for multi-modal data analysis. Currently pursuing a PhD in Computer Engineering at Stony Brook University, I bring a unique blend of academic research and industry experience to the field of AI and machine learning.

As a Graduate Research Assistant, I have made impactful contributions to NLP and ML pipelines, enhancing accuracy while optimizing computational efficiency. My work encompasses designing and implementing hybrid ML models, integrating cutting-edge NLP techniques, and advancing model interpretability in large language models. By exploring the nuances of spoken language, I have helped uncover and address linguistic ambiguities, driving more robust and intelligent AI systems.

In my professional roles, I've leveraged my skills to drive tangible business results. At Zippi Delivery, I developed cross-platform applications that increased order volume by 60% and attracted over 1000 new customers. At Accenture, I applied frequent pattern mining to improve customer retention by 18% through personalized product recommendations.

My research has led to multiple publications in prestigious conferences, focusing on semantic classification of dialog, team effectiveness optimization, and human behavior understanding for IoT applications.

I'm always eager to collaborate on challenging projects that push the boundaries of AI and machine learning. Let's connect and explore how we can drive innovation together!
